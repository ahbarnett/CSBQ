Folder for slender body theory experiments.

All MATLAB code. Do `startup` in MATLAB before running.

Codes:

`falling_torus.m` : symmetric torus lying in xy-plane, with const velocity (0,0,U), comparing SBT and exact mobility solution
`test_spec_toy.m` : check spectrum of toy operator, the zz-component of SBT on unit circle


Results figures are in `figs` and text output in `output`
